# ðŸŒ— Theme Toggle & Word Counter â€“ JavaScript Mini Project

This is a simple JavaScript-based project featuring two interactive functionalities:

1. **Theme Toggle**:  
   A toggle button allows users to seamlessly switch between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode**, enhancing accessibility and user preference.

2. **Live Word Counter**:  
   A text input field is provided where users can type freely. Below the field, a dynamic **word counter** displays the number of words entered in real time.
